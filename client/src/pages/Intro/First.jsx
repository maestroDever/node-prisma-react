        The first step is what we call "Prevoting": On election day, you only
        get to pick one candidate, but you might like several candidates, while
        really disliking others.

          Right now there's no way to make any of these preferences count,
        </span>{" "}
        or to have them influence how others might want to vote
      </p>

      <p>
        Indecision 2020 records and aggregates these preferences as Pre-Votes in
        order to help voters build coalitions and pick the collectively optimal
        candidate.
